This is PDO usage example which shows following things:
 - How to get started with PDO
 - How to Make classes and make a efficient ORM which does the job!
 - How to use the __set magical method of classes
 - How to create objects from table which are in 3rd NF and have many-to-many relationship
    -- An exmaple of Person and Subject is implemented in which a person can opt for many subjects
    and one particular subject could be opted by many Person (I should have used Student but its just an exmaple.)

How to make it work:
1. dump the SQL file (exp_pdo.sql) in mysql or any db of ur choice
2. change the config (config.php) to reflect ur changes of database
3. hit the main.php in browser.
